<p>From D-hostel in the Bharati Vidyapeeth campus in Katraj, Pune to the centre stage of some of the most prestigious technology events, its been a journey worth every bit of it.</p>

<p>Born into a business-oriented family, entrepreneurship was in my blood. I grew up under the influence of my father, who himself is an accomplished Civil Engineer with extraordinary problem solving skills and my mother who till date is the most motivated person I have ever known. Leadership was in my lineage, and my childhood had toughened me enough to take the world head on.</p>

<p>From a very early age I was helping out in my fatherâ€™s construction business, that gave me an insight into the world of workforce management and execution. Getting things done is the first and the foremost attribute of a successful entrepreneur. A close second, is the ability to sell it. As I saw projects after projects getting built in front of me, and each one with a unique set of problems, each having an even more unique set of solutions that were seldom from a textbook and more from experience and genius, it developed my acumen for finding ways out of difficult situations and taking calculated risks.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id='smiley_icon_thats_me'><img alt='smiley icon' src='/assets/themes/twitter/bootstrap/img/crazy_smiley.jpeg' /> That&#8217;s Me!</h4>

<p>I have always been good at making friends and enemies alike, and that helped me in taking unpopular but productive and progressive decisions that have a larger overall impact. The college life and especially heading the marketing team for the college festivals helped me in building my skills of finding the right partners for the right initiative.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id='gaming_icon_the_gaming_phase'><img alt='gaming icon' src='/assets/themes/twitter/bootstrap/img/I-Love-Gaming.jpeg' /> The Gaming Phase</h4>

<p>My journey into the web and software started with, not surprisingly, gaming. It was the age of massive <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_game'>multiplayer online games</a>, and I really dig into it. Before I knew it, I was developing parts of these games with developers across the globe. By the time I was in second year of college, not only was I good at gaming, but was able to sustain myself independently.</p>

<p>Internet had redefined the way we think, work and live. So, it made sense to work on it and build solutions that not only help people in getting things done faster but are also a viable business proposition. In third year of college itself, I started my own software development company along with a couple of classmates. Being the fastest technical hand in the team, I was able to gain a lot of experience in a short amount of time. The guidance from my siblings who were back then thriving in their careers in the various tech giants helped me give direction to our company on the technology front.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id='weboman_icon_the_webonise_chapter'><img alt='weboman icon' src='/assets/themes/twitter/bootstrap/img/weboman.jpg' /> The Webonise Chapter</h4>

<p>Apparently, there was something even bigger and better in store. As we moved on and found ourselves competing with a lot of established players in the market, it made sense to join hands with someone already out there. But it was difficult to find the environment I was looking for. If you want to create value you need to be part of an ecosystem that is based on strong principles and an open culture. That is when I got to know about <strong>Webonise Labs</strong> from a very close friend.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.webonise.com/'>Webonise</a> at that time was a 10 people company working out of a small office virtually invisible to the world. But the energy was amazing, the moment I stepped in and met the guys, it was like finding the reason that you keep looking for. They wanted to build something great, something exciting, something that will be a game changer. We started building products, that gave us a taste of the real world, and before we realised we were begin sought after by various local and international startups to help them in building their ideas and bringing them on the web.</p>

<h4 id='webonise_icon_growing_with_webonise'><img alt='webonise icon' src='/assets/themes/twitter/bootstrap/img/webonise.jpeg' /> Growing with Webonise</h4>

<p>My skill and past experiences with technology helped me in building a great team of engineers and we were able to scale to multi million dollar projects within three years. The stress on quality and getting things done on time made sure that <em><a href='http://www.webonise.com/%27'>Webonise Labs</a> became a technology partner of various organisations around the world</em>. We expanded operations to the US and partnered with companies in Europe and Canada and were able to provide complex solutions on niche technologies.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id='weboman_icon__here_i_am'><img alt='weboman icon' src='/assets/themes/twitter/bootstrap/img/proud_smiley.jpeg' /> &#8230; here I am.</h4>

<p>Today, I am the <strong>Assistant Vice President of Engineering</strong> at <strong><a href='http://www.webonise.com/'>Webonise Labs</a></strong>, creating products and building teams across continents. What I learned over time is that, its not just about creating business value, its about thought leadership. Its about giving back to the community and embracing change to grow and to always keep moving forward.</p>
