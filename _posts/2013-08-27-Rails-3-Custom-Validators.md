* **Its simple!** Just keep your mind open to new things and keep learning(*even if its stupid and small*).

  e.g. `print vs. puts`

* **Be patient**. It takes time.
  Self teaching is the best teaching. The Ruby Community, having an open source community of active and enthusiastic *rubyists*, will help you while you learn. Share your knowledge and you will get twice in return.

* **Don't be Selffish :P** Don't learn with an intention to keep the knowledge to yourself.
  Learn so that one day you can give back to the community and make your own contributions.

* **Share your thoughts** Share your ideas and opinions towards ruby, and you will get interesting responses. Syntax is something just for the learning sake. What u really need to understand is there is more to it than meets the eye.

* **Discuss More** Discuss your experiences with other *rubyists*, and listen to what they have to give in return. It will widen your outlook and expand your horizon.

* The moto of any great Rubyist is - **Love**, **Live**, **Share**, **Care**.
   * **Love Ruby!** But don't restrict yourself to just Ruby. *Explore!*
   * **Work Hard!** But take your time off for a holiday.. *trust me you need it ;)*
   * **Share!** You may become an inspiration for someone someday with your contribution.
